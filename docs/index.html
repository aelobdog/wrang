Writing static sites in plain html is unarguably a

.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
Most people would use <em>markdown</em> or <em>asciidoc</em> or <em>restructured text</em> or something of the sort to make their lives easier and so did I, until I wrote my own tool 
<a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/sitefl">sitefl</a>
. But when I wrote sitefl, I wasn't really paying much attention to code quality ... or literally pretty much anything other than results. And for a while, it did work. I mean, it still works technically, its just that I felt like I could've done better.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
Wrang is my attempt at making sitefl better. It is written in C, but the reason isn't anything related to performance or anything, its just that I'm more comfortable in C now than I am in Go. It surely does help that the resulting binary is smaller, but that's just a bonus.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
Wrang tries to be compatible with sitefl, but due to my organizational skills (or the lack thereof) I've based it on a version of sitefl that may not be the one you see on github. I suppose though that the (only?) change is probably in the way headings are written, <code>#3</code> vs the old markdown style <code>###</code>.
